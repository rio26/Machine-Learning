[Homework 1]
Solve the following two tasks:

T1: Load the Olympic men’s 400m data (stored in the file olympics.mat). Fit 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th order polynomial functions to this data. Use 10-fold cross-validation to choose the “best” polynomial order between 1 and 4 which has lowest error. What is the “best” model based on average cross-validation loss?

T2: Using 5-fold cross-validation, find the value of 𝜆 that gives the “best” predictive performance on the Olympic men’s 100m data (stored in the file olympics.mat) for (a) 1st order polynomial (i.e. the standard linear model) and (b) 4th order polynomial.
